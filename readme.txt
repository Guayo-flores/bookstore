# Welcome to the Bookstore Analysis Project

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is my personal project where Iâ€™m building a full-stack **Flask web app** with a **PostgreSQL database** to manage a bookstore.  
Itâ€™s both a learning experience and a practical system to handle books, authors, categories, and more.

## Features
- User registration, login, and role-based access (admin vs. user)
- Admin dashboard to manage authors, categories, and books
- File uploads for book covers and digital files
- Wishlist functionality for users
- Contact form with message storage in the database

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (Flask), psycopg2, Flask-WTF
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (local + Neon cloud)
- **Frontend:** HTML, Bootstrap 5
- **Deployment:** Render (app) + Neon (database)

   ```bash
